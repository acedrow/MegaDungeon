<!-- Mockup for the xml format for holding out level data

- root element is the level
- level is the parent of a series of room elements, each room has an attribute denoting the size of the room as a coordinate point (x,y) - width,height.
- rooms have tile elements, with an attribute denoting the tile's coordinate within the room.
	-(note, these coordinates start at 0,0, representing the lower left hand tile. Thus, in a 5x5 room, the upper right hand tile would have the coordinate 4,4) 
- tile elements ,may have features (things that occupy the center of the square, pillars, altars, - DO FEATURES /ALWAYS/ BLOCK MOVEMENT?)
- tile elements cmay have edgeFeatures (usually doors and walls), which occupy one edge of the tile, will have a direction integer, corresponding to a cardinal direction: 0 is north, 1 east, 2 south, and 3 west.

Example room, 5 tiles by 5 tiles in size, has a door in the middle of the north wall, with a acid trap pressure plate on the same tile. An altar lies in the center of the room, and there is a pillar in each corner.
